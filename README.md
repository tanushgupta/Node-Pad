# Node-Pad
A mean stack application that allows user to create notes and share with friends you want to share with. The application uses Angular-2 for the front-end. MongoDB to store data on the server. Nodejs and Expressjs to create the middleware and perform the functionality of the application. I have used JWT in the application to perform user authentication and security.
